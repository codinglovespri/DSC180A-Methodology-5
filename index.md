## Questions:
**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** <br>
  The most interesting thing that was covered in my domain this quarter is learning how smart contracts actually function. My understanding of smart contracts in the beginning stages of the project was very abstract, and because of that, it was a little difficult to fully understand how they work. It wasn;t until we practiced by running and publishing a smart contract using Remix and Metamask that I started to grasp how smart contracts function in the real world. <br>
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** <br>
  A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project is to look into the legal implications of the smart contract. This is important because if the smart contract breaches any laws, this could lead to legal issues, undermining the smart contract. Therefore, I wouuld spend ample time to investigate and research the legal rules of smart contracts and make sure the contract complies with the rules. <br>
**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** <br>
  A potential change I would make to the approach in my Quart 1 Project is to include a portion that allows my smart contract to handle edge cases or unforeseen issues. For example, if a customer fails to verify a transaction within a given time frame, how will the smart contract handle the situation? Another edge case could include if a network encounters too much traffic, or if users try to hack the system. For the Quarter 2 project, I plan to make sure my smart contract is able to handle all these edge cases ad have fallback mechanisms to be a robust smart contract.
